#NodeJS Log in System
This repo contains a log in system written in Javascript, using NodeJS

##Synopsis
The middleware architecture, is the base of the library and gives us the power to write complex but, at the same time, flexible applications. The example we used was a simple one. 

We required a valid session to provide page access. However, it illustrates the usage of the body parser middleware and the process of registering the new routes. We also updated the Jade templates and saw the results in the browser.
